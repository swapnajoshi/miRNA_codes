Abstract: MicroRNAs are known to play a important role in pathophysiology of IBS.
  We compared microRNA profiles of 30 IBS patients and 15 healthy controls (HCs) in
  plasma as well as colonic mucosal biopsies of all subjects. We found miR-150 among
  other miRNAs to be deregulated in circulation as reported previously. Thirty nine
  microRNAs were differentially regulated between IBS and HCs in biopsy samples. Five
  miRNAs were differentially expressed both in circulation as well as biopsies. Association
  of clinical traits such as severity of IBS symtoms tested for circulating as well
  as biopsy miRNA revealed....
